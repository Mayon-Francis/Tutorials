In the Last three Articles, (Find them here if you missed them, Article 1, Article 2, Article 3) We went deep into what ipfs is and how to use it. Now Letâ€™s talk about why should we actually be using ipfs.

## Benefits of IPFS

The number one selling point of using ipfs is that all data that you store is decentralised. If youâ€™re building a decentralised app, then using a centralised server to store data is intrinsically wrong. Data once sent to the network is immutable and thus tamper-resistant. This enforces data security.

IPFS is also **Censorship Resistant.** We say this because

- Every piece of data is decentralised, and no central authority can block access to any information.
- Anyone can pin any data to the network. They do not need *permission from the network* to do so.
- If someone is hosting some illegal data, it will be openly visible, as by the nature of ipfs, everything is public.

From 29 April 2017 to 15 January 2020, the online encyclopediaÂ Wikipedia wasÂ blocked inÂ Turkey. This is just one example of how centralised data storage can easily be blocked. The ipfs team responded by uploading a mirror of Turkish Wikipedia on the ipfs network demonstrating its uncensorable nature.

## IPFS Use Cases

- IPFS is a flexible protocol which can obviously be used for distributed file storage.
- It can also be used as a proof platform as once data is sent to the network, it is immutable and thus the validity of some data can be verified by anyone.

## Drawbacks of IPFS

Just like everything else, ipfs has itâ€™s own share of drawbacks as well.

- **Economic Incentive**
    
    IPFS does not include any economic incentive with it for people to keep running their nodes. Filecoin was created on top of ipfs, as a network which uses ipfs as the backbone, but with the addition of an extra incentive model to supercharge its growth.
    
- **Public data**
    
    While this in itself is one of ipfsâ€™ selling points, private data that must not be openly exposed exist as well.
    
    There are solutions that exist out there for this including [pinata submarine](https://www.pinata.cloud/blog/introducing-submarining-what-it-is-why-you-need-it). But letâ€™s look at a file-sharing platform known as [Fileverse](https://fileverse.io/).
